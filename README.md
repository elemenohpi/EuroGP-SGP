----------------------------------

**Installation:**

SGP is written in Python and therefore you will need a Python installation on your system. SGP is tested with Python 3.8+

The libraries required for running SGP are: [requirements.txt](https://github.com/elemenohpi/EuroGP-SGP/blob/main/requirements.txt)

----------------------------------

**Running and Configuration:**

Running SGP is as simple as running:

`python sgp.py`

You will have to edit the [config.ini](https://github.com/elemenohpi/EuroGP-SGP/blob/main/config.ini) file in order to specify the parameters of your experiment. This is where you can select your operators/modules/settings. In order to introduce new operators to the system and check the existing examples in [Operators](https://github.com/elemenohpi/EuroGP-SGP/tree/main/Operators.
